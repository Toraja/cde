= Env Skeleton

== Setup

=== From scratch
. Copy `bundle` directory into `env` directory and rename it to anything you like.
. Replace `bundle` in `docker-bake.hcl` with the directory name.
. Likewise, rename `project` directory and replace `project` in `docker-bake.hcl` with the directory name.
** If you only have single project and wish to avoid extra hierarcy in
  directory structure, move things inside `project` directory up to `bundle`
  directory and modify `context` in `docker-bake.hcl` accordingly.
** On the contrary, if you have more projects to add within the same `bundle`,
  duplicate `project` directory and modify `Dockerfile` in it. +
  Also, add the target for project in `docker-bake.hcl`.

=== Use external setup
If you have set up necessary files somewhere else, make a symlink to the location. +

== Dockerfile
By default, `catalogs` directory is given as addtional context during build. +
Pick things you need from it and run the installers.
