= Organize Dockerfile contents
:toc:

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: me

== Context and Problem Statement
The contents of Dockerfile is large and hard to read, so each chunk of commands
has be categorised well.
Arrange in a way that is easier to understand and edit later.

== Decision Drivers

* How easy to read
* How easy to edit

== Considered Options

* 1. Categorise each chunk by linux process/command
** e.g. all `apt-get` in one place, `pip` in another...
* 2. Categorise by what each command is required by.
** e.g. This part is for `vim`, That is for `tmux` ...

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 2

Reason: +
It makes easier to understand which packages/softwares are required by what.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== [option 1]

Pros and Cons are the opposite of [option 2].

=== [option 2]

==== Pros
* Easy to remove packages/softwares because you know what requires those.

==== Cons
* Dockerfile will have more steps, meaning there will be more intermediate images and hence more capacity is used.
