= [short title of solved problem and solution]
:toc:

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: me

== Context and Problem Statement

For commands that require non-default shell (e.g. bash), commands will look
like `bash -c 'do something'` and it looks ugly. +
(Especially on editors, quoted strings are highlighted so the commands will
look like string though they are actually not.)

== Decision Drivers

* Look elegant
* Does not inflate image too much nor occupies much storage

== Considered Options

* `bash -c 'do something'`
* Use `SHELL` instruction
* Create dedicated scripts

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 2 & 3

Reason: +
Use option 2 for where `RUN` instruction contains only commands that require different shell. +
Use option 3 otherwise.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== [option 1]

[source,dockerfile]
----
RUN bash -c 'cmd1 \
    cmd2 \
    cmd3'
RUN fish -c 'cmd1 \
    cmd2 \
    cmd3'
----

==== Pros
* The effect of changing shell is only for that instruction, so there will be
  no unintended side effect.

==== Cons
* Quotations look ugly. +

=== [option 2]

[source,dockerfile]
----
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
RUN cmd1 \
    cmd2 \
    cmd3
SHELL ["/usr/bin/fish", "-c"]
RUN cmd1 \
    cmd2 \
    cmd3
SHELL ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
----

==== Pros
* No ugly quotations.

==== Cons
* You need to be aware that changing `SHELL` might cause unintended side effect
  on other `RUN`, `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions. +
  (`bash` should work fine though.)
* To avoid that, you need to set `SHELL` back to original and that clutters Dockerfile.
* If commands in `RUN` instruction are chained and not all the commands
  required different shell, those commands are run in the modified `SHELL` as
  well.

=== [option 3]

[source,dockerfile]
----
COPY ./script1.sh /tmp/script1.sh
RUN script1.sh
COPY ./script2.sh /tmp/script2.sh
RUN script2.sh
----

==== Pros
* Fewer lines of code in Dockerfile.
* No unintended side effect of changing shell.

==== Cons
* `COPY` instruction add another layer and that takes storage.
* If you try to reduce layers by copying multiple scripts together, and you
  need change one of those script, cache after `COPY` command will be
  invalidated and build starts from `COPY` command. +
  In the below example, modifying `script2.sh` cause docker to build from
  `COPY`, results in running `script1.sh` which is not changed.
+
[source,dockerfile]
----
COPY ./scripts-dir /tmp/
RUN /tmp/script1.sh
RUN /tmp/script2.sh
