= Files required in both building image and host setup
:toc:

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: me

== Context and Problem Statement

Host setup needs some of the files under `root/ctx/home/.local/bin`. +
It's very awkward to access those binaries from host setup context.

== Decision Drivers

* Shared files can be placed somewhere outside the `root` context.
* Does not look awkward

== Considered Options

* Use build context of docker buildx
* Bind mount
* Release those files and download them when necessary

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 3 +

.Reason
* Want to learn releasing
* Write tools in other languages

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== [option 1]

==== Pros
* Minimal work

==== Cons
* buildx is required and docker compose does not support it (which is not really a con as it is already introduced)

=== [option 2]

==== Pros
* `COPY` instruction is not needed.

==== Cons
* Mounted directory covers up the files created during the build.

=== [option 3]

==== Pros
* It is easier to use languages other than shell script.

==== Cons
* A lot of work to do.
* Fixed versions of those files need to be released before they can be used in the build process.
