= Volume Policy
:toc:

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: me

== Context and Problem Statement

Here it is documented that when to use what kind of docker volume. +
Written in free format as this is not about deciding which option is better.

== Volume
=== Bind mount
* Need to sync between containers and host machine
** Files for date/time and docker socket
* Need to be accessed/modified on the host side as well
** Files in this repository
* Created/modified during container runtime and accidental deletion cannot be tolerated.
** Files under workspace directory that are stored only locally.
* It is difficult to produce during build process.
** Credential files

=== External volume
* None of the condition for bind volume applies.
* Need to share between different containers.
* Accidental deletion by `docker-compose down -v` should be avoided.
** Note that it is still prone to `docker volume prune` if the volume is not used by any container.
** To avoild that, labels should be added to those volumes and `pruneFilter` should be set in `config.json`.

=== Volume
* None of the condition for other volume methods applies.
* Need to persist across container life cycle (such as shell history)
