= Install go tools
:toc:

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: me

== Context and Problem Statement

Go tools (such as `gopls`) are installed manually using neovim plugin during container runtime and the installed directory is mounted as a volume. +
This causes unused tools to remain undeleted, and old tools to remain old. +

== Decision Drivers

* Make sure only necessary tools are installed.
* Those tools are regularly updated.

== Considered Options

. Install using neovim plugin during build time
. Install all tools one by one using `go install`

== Decision Outcome

.Chosen option
2

.Reason
Option 1 is hard to achieve.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

Let `go.nvim` plugin isntall them.

=== [option 1]

[source,sh]
----
nvim --headless -c GoInstallBinaries -c qall
----

==== Pros
* You do not need to track the list of go tools to install manually.

==== Cons
* The command runs asynchronously and does not emits any event when it completes, so neovim quits before istallation is completed.

=== [option 2]

Install the list of go tools that `go.nvim` plugin installs (defined in `go.nvim/lua/go/install.lua`).

[source,sh]
----
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest \
&& go install ...
----

==== Pros
* Not particularly good, but at least achievable.

==== Cons
* Hard to keep track of the list of latest go tools.
