= Running commands requiring other shell
:toc:

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: me

== Context and Problem Statement

In some cases, bash options like `-e` is preferred to avoid unnecessary execution of commands. +

== Decision Drivers

* Look elegant
* Does not increase the number of cached intermediate images too much

== Considered Options

* `set -e && ...` whenever necessary
* Wrap commands in `SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-e", "-c"]` & `SHELL ["/bin/sh", "-c"]` whenever necessary
* Set `SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-e", "-c"]` at the top of root image use it for all `RUN` instructions

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 3

Reason: +
* Simple and no or little change of existing `RUN` instructions is required.
* Ubuntu images are shipped with bash, and bash is required in the final image.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

Pros and Cons for option 1 & 2 are illustrated in link:file://0002-set-shell-option-to-use-bash.adoc[0002-set-shell-option-to-use-bash.adoc].

=== [option 3]

==== Pros
* Fewer lines of code in Dockerfile.

==== Cons
* Might require some fix to existing `RUN` instructions
